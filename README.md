# Where should the next hospital in Victoria be positioned?
The proximity of a hospital has a significant impact on the health of vulnerable citizens. Victoria has an expanding population, and a capital city that stretches borders to keep up with urban density growth. Consequently, Victoria’s public services will soon be exhausted and reach the maximum service limit. To combat this, this research project will identify weak spots in Victoria’s infrastructure to determine where the next hospital in Victoria would best be placed. Tackling this problem will require deep research into the sustainability of Victoria’s population growth as well as certain aspects of the liveability of Victorians.
